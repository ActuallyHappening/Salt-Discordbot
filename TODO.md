## new requirements
- Log each stage of the transaction (in JS library),
probably going to require a new config parameter in the JS library
and maybe a new CLI pipe/file to write extra logs that aren't in stdout?
- Make links to the block explorer urls (in JS library)
- Write docs that the links go to

## nice to do
- Don't publish stdout, clean up error handling to avoid leaking random stuff
